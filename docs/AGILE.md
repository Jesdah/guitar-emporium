# Agile.
During the entire development stage of Guitar Emporium, I have used an agile approach.
I found it quite difficult in the beginning to get all my ideas down in text. I decide to start with the basic building blocks and when the ideas start to come, I write down my user stories.
The whole project has felt like a long roller coaster, it has gone from ideas coming to everything standing still.
So during the course of the project, I have from time to time written new user stories and divided these into Epics.<br>

## Project.

Throughout the project, I have evaluated the situation and written new user stories if necessary.

## Epics.

I have connected all user stories to epics.

1. An Epic to set the fundamentals.<br>

This Epic I created to make sure all the fundamental building blocks were in place before I started my project.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * Deploy to heroku 
    * create base.html
    * Install Django

2. Install alluth for registration.<br>
