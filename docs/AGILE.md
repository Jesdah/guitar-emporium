# Agile
During the entire development stage of Guitar Emporium, I have used an agile approach.
I found it quite difficult in the beginning to get all my ideas down in text. I decided to start with the basic building blocks and when the ideas started to come, I wrote down my user stories.
The whole project has felt like a long roller coaster, it has gone from ideas coming to everything standing still.
So during the course of the project, I have from time to time written new user stories and divided these into Epics.<br>

## Project
![Screenshot of project page](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-project.png)<br>
Throughout the project, I have evaluated the situation and written new user stories if necessary.

## Epics
![Screenshot of all the epics](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epics.png)<br>
I have connected all user stories to epics.

1. An Epic to set the fundamentals<br>
![Screenshot of epic 1](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epic-setup.png)<br>
This Epic I created to make sure all the fundamental building blocks were in place before I started my project.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * Deploy to heroku 
    * create base.html
    * Install Django

2. Install alluth for registration<br>
![Screenshot of epic 2](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epic-login.png)<br>
This Epic I created to install allauth with working authorization so users can login, logout and create a new profile without errors.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * Install allauth without errors.

3. Create guitar app<br>
![Screenshot of epic 3](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epic-guitar.png)<br>
This is the most comprehensive Epic as the whole app is centered around the guitar page which has meant that it has been very important that there are no errors or broken links.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * categories
    * create guitar model
    * Guitar description
    * Guitar page
    * Add and remove products

    * create Guitar views

4. Create profile app<br>
![Screenshot of epic 4](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epic-profile.png)<br>
The most important thing for me when I created my profile page was that it should have a clear purpose. The user must be able to have all their activity collected in one place.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * create profile model 
    * See my previous purchases
    * Create a profile

5. Create cart app<br>

    * create cart
    * Edit cart

6. Create wishlist app<br>

Wishlist is somehow connected to the profile app, a logged in user can add items to their wish list and administer them through the profile page.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * create wishlist model
    * wishlist

7. Create review app<br>
![Screenshot of epic 7](/docs/agile_images/guitar-emporium-epic-review.png)<br>
Since the goods on the site are exclusive, it was very important that the customer chould read as much as possible before deciding to click on purchase, and then it has been fundamental to have an opportunity to add reviews.<br>
Epic is done when all points are completed:
    * Review
    * Review.html
